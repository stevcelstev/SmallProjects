# Snake

I have made a small game of Snake following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/5tvER0MT14s, but this time instead of the turtle module, I have used the pygame module.
The game is fairly simple right now (I haven't added anything of my own right now, but I plan some change in mind: like changing the way the eyes are facing (right now
the eyes are always facing upwards) and if the snake moves in a direction, I want to stop the possibility of moving in the opposite direction. The final goal of this
project would be to make it like the original Snake games: that after a certain amount of points have been adeed, a gate will be created that will teleport the snake to
another level, basically make the game a bit more complex and test my game design talents).
