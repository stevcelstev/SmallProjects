# Pong

<p>This is a small game of Pong that I have made based on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH8WgrUWG_I&list=PLlEgNdBJEO-kXk2PyBxhSmo84hsO3HAz2.
It is a fairly simple game, having the possibility to be played by 2 players (although the movement of the pallets cannot be done simultaneously because in this tutorial
the turtle library/module for Python is used and 2 or more turtles cannot move at the same time. Maybe I can overcome this problem by using pygame. As a sidenote maybe 
for the next game I will do that).</p>

<p>I took the liberty to add two more functionalities to this game besides those presented in the tutorial: the one to simply quit the game and to restart the game. Also,
I have added a winning condition for the players (to reach a total of 10 points, condition that I can change in the future if I see that it is necessary).</p>

<p>I have a plan that in the future I will create a AI for the game to play against the player (possibly giving the choice to the player to choose to play against the 
AI or against another player) and also to change to module to pygame so by doing that I can eliminate the inconvinience for the two players to not be able to move
simultaneously.</p>
